      <p>Front-End Developer with a background in management within finance, education and healthcare.
        I have extensive experience in managing problems, collaborating with others to create solutions, and working
        with all types of personalities. I have met deadlines and successfully finished projects. I have transitioned back
        to web development as circumstances in my life allowed for a greater use of my talents.</p>

        <p>I completed the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp where I advanced my skills in html, css, javascript and jQuery. I am passionate about solving challenges from different angles and collaborating with teams to create meaningful
        web applications.</p>
        
        <p>I am looking for a position utilizing the skills I have and those learned in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I feel
        that these skills combined with my tech and leadership skills make me a valuable asset to any development
        team.</em></p>
